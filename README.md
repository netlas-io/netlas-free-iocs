# Netlas Free IOCs

This repository provides a free and regularly updated database of malicious hosts to support security researchers and practitioners in their threat intelligence efforts. The data is generated by leveraging information from the Abuse.ch SSL Certificate Blacklist and Netlas Internet Scan Data.

## Technical Description

1. **Source Data**:  
   We use the Abuse.ch SSL Certificate Blacklist, a publicly available feed of SSL certificates associated with malicious activities such as phishing and malware distribution.

2. **Data Processing**:  
   We leverage the latest Netlas Internet Scan Data to identify active hosts that match SHA1 SSL certificates from the Abuse.ch feed. Matching hosts are flagged as malicious and included in the final dataset.

3. **Database Generation**:  
   The processed data is exported in CSV format for easy integration with threat intelligence workflows. The resulting file is published in this repository.

## Output File

The main output file (`abuse.ch_sslbl_malicious_hosts_by_netlas.csv`) contains:
- URLs associated with malicious SSL certificates.
- Threat names.
- Timestamps for the first observed presence (`fseen`) and the last observed occurrence (`lseen`).
