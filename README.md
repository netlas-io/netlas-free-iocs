# Netlas Free IOCs

This repository provides a free and regularly updated database of malicious hosts to support security researchers and practitioners in their threat intelligence efforts. The data is generated by leveraging the [Abuse.ch SSL Certificate Blacklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch) and Netlas Internet Scan Data.


## Technical Description

1. **Source Data**:  
   We use the [Abuse.ch SSL Certificate Blacklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch), a publicly available feed of SSL certificates flagged for malicious activities such as phishing, malware distribution, and botnet operations.

2. **Data Processing**:  
   Using SHA1 hashes of SSL certificates from the Abuse.ch feed, the latest Netlas Internet Scan Data is queried to identify active hosts utilizing these certificates. Hosts identified as active and matching malicious certificates are flagged and added to the dataset.

3. **Database Generation**:  
   The processed data is exported in CSV format, making it easy to integrate into various threat intelligence workflows and security tools.

4. **Schedule**:  
   The repository is updated daily to ensure the data remains current and actionable.

## Output File

The main output file (`abuse.ch_sslbl_malicious_hosts_by_netlas.csv`) contains:
- URLs associated with malicious SSL certificates.
- Threat names corresponding to malicious activities.
- Timestamps for the first observed presence (`fseen`) and the last observed occurrence (`lseen`).
