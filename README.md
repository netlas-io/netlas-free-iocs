# Netlas Free IOCs

This repository provides a free and regularly updated database of malicious hosts to support security researchers and practitioners in their threat intelligence efforts. The data is generated by leveraging the [Abuse.ch SSL Certificate Blacklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch) and Netlas Internet Scan Data.

**Important:**  The content of this repository is under active development. File formats, scripts, and structure may change in the near future.


## Technical Description

1. **Source Data**:  
   We use the [Abuse.ch SSL Certificate Blacklist](https://sslbl.abuse.ch), a publicly available feed of SSL certificates flagged for malicious activities such as phishing, malware distribution, and botnet operations.

2. **Data Processing**:  
   Using SHA1 hashes of SSL certificates from the Abuse.ch feed, the latest Netlas Internet Scan Data is queried to identify active hosts utilizing these certificates. Hosts identified as active and matching malicious certificates are flagged and added to the dataset.

3. **Database Generation**:  
   The processed data is exported in CSV, that contains malicious service URI, threat name, and two timestamps â€“ "first seen" and "last seen".

4. **Schedule**:  
   The database is updated daily.

## Output File

The main output file (`abuse_ch_sslbl_malicious_hosts_by_netlas.csv`) contains:
- URLs associated with malicious SSL certificates.
- Threat names corresponding to malicious activities.
- Timestamps for the first observed presence (`fseen`) and the last observed occurrence (`lseen`).

## Reproducing the Data

The easiest way to use this repository is to download the ready-to-use file (`abuse.ch_sslbl_malicious_hosts_by_netlas.csv`) included in the repository, which is updated daily. However, if you wish to reproduce the data yourself, please note that a paid Netlas account is required due to the large number of API requests and the volume of data needed for processing.

To reproduce the data, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**   
   Download the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/netlas-io/netlas-free-iocs.git
   cd netlas-free-iocs
   ```

2. **Install the requirements**    
   Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Save the Netlas API key**   
   Configure your Netlas API key using the Netlas SDK:

   ```bash
   netlas savekey YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

4. **Run the script**   
   Execute the update script to generate the latest dataset:

   ```bash
   netlas savekey YOUR_API_KEY
   ```
